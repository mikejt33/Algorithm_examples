This assignment is due on Monday 11/21 by 11:59 pm.

You will work in three (or four) person groups as below:

	Fanny Chow - Jackie Scholl - Roger Filmyer
	Jeremiah Cohen - Michael McCormack - Stephanie Rivera
	Noah Johnson - Lilianne Raud - Beau Britain
	Saad Usmani - Shane Caldwell - Lydia Laseur
	Adriana Souza - Mackenzie Gray - Richard Decal
	Kevin Hunt - Xiaotai Chai - Joseph Comer - David Duffrin

What I want you to do is to write a routine, or modify existing code, to "train" (as in, find good coefficients) a three neuron feed-forward neural net we discussed in class for an XOR input/output relationship using a conjugate-gradient algorithm with a line-search.

As a reminder, the three logits (perceptrons) are to be arranged as follows:

	x1 - P1 \
	   X     P3 - y
	x2 - P2 /
	
And, the XOR gate can be thought of as four data points (x1,x2) producing a particular response (y):

	x1   x2   y
	0    0    0
	0    1    1
	1    0    1
	1    1    0

NOTE: I also want the gradient to be computed and programmed by you via back-propagation. DO NOT USE AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION. DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE VIA PERTURBATION.
